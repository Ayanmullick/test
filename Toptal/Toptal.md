This is a design for a secure and scalable e-commerce webapp for a retail startup in Azure. With Azure Functions and Web Apps, so you can create personalized experiences while Azure takes care of the infrastructure.

## <u>Architecture</u>

![Architecture diagram](Toptal.jpg)
<sub><u>**Physical**</u> diagram for the Azure Resources in line with industry standards and Microsoft recommendations. The more detailed diagram for the logical components of the application would need to be created by the application developers.</sub>

<details close><summary><u>Design decisions</u></summary><p>

1. **Authentication**: Both developers and end users will authenticate against Azure AD. The developers would back in their code into an AzDevops repository after being authorized. And the end users will go through FrontDoor and consume Cosmos DB in the back end. Partners can consume API’s hosted on AzFunctions thru API management.

2. **NoSQL database**: Cosmos DB will need to be configured with a [global distribution Consistency level][2] configuration that is in line with the application's requirements.

3. **Alert Operations flow**: This document defines the infrastructure operations for this software. The actual agile methodology for developers to test and check in code into the Azure repository would need to be worked out along with the application owner and the project managers.This also demonstrates to the investors how we are operationalizing security alerts and what the plan would be in case of a breach based on industry standards and Microsoft recommendations.

4. **Static WebApp**: Avoiding a middleware would enable scaling the application for millions of users across continents.

5. **API Management**: The sensitive data that are exposed from API endpoints would be accessible for partners through Azure API management. And partners would be issued their own API keys for protection.

6. **Azure Alerts**: Security center alerts and service health alerts are specific Azure monitoring components that would enable the company to respond to attacks in the long term.

1. User accesses the web app in browser and signs in.
2. Browser pulls static resources such as images from Azure Content Delivery Network.
3. User searches for products and queries SQL database.
4. Web site pulls product catalog from Cosmosdb.
5. Web app pulls product images from the CDN connected to Blob Storage.
