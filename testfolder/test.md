This is an architecture. M4a. Hello world in the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform. For any application canvas art with is some form of Sportage. In this case we will start with a SQL database. So we have a table in the SQL database with two rows as you can see. The hello world code would reside in Azure functions. 

For our use case lets a user iron Malik is going to crudite the database through the code in Azure functions and let's say another user john Doe will also creativity his data from the same database the source for authentication would be azure b2c. And the hello word API would be exposed to the internet true the Azure API Management Service. 

When the users query the API they would first be authenticated against the Azure b2c directory. And then aPI management will invoke the function which will fetch the data from the SQL database for each of these users. 

So when I am calls the AP it should respond hello I am. And when John cleary's that he it should say hello John and we would need to achieve this by implementing SQL row level security inside the Azure database.
